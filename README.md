# Nokia Snake

A simple remake of the Nokia Snake game

## Description

This game was created during a code along with Ania Kubow on her youtube channel. 
It uses functional programming and DOM manipulation to create a grid for the game
and movements of characters. It was a great way to learn popular built in JavaScript
methods, as well as using event keys to allow the user to move the snake around the 
screen/grid while also randomizing the location of the 'apple'.
